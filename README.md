# Find the Optimal Chopstick Length
Use unsupervised learning techniques to see if any similarities exist between customers and how to best segment customers into distinct categories.
## Purpose:

This project provided me with an opportunity to work with a popular tool and gain confidence in interpreting data. I also got a chance to apply what I learned in Lesson 1 of Statistics using Python. I went deeper in this direction during Introduction to Data Science and Project 2.

## How to use:
The project has 3 files:
* chopsticks.html: Final Report
* chopsticks.ipynb: This is the main file where my work was performed the project.
* chopstick-effectiveness.csv: The project dataset.

### To view results 
Open up a browser window or tab. Click file then open. Navigate to the folder containing the project files and double click chopsticks.html .
### To interact with ipynb file
In the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the folder containing the project files, and then use the command jupyter notebook chopsticks.ipynb to open up a browser window or tab to work with your notebook.
